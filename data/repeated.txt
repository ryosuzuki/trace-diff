Repeated
Implement repeated(f, n):

- f is a one-argument function that takes a number and returns another number.
- n is a non-negative integer

repeated returns another function that, when given an argument x, will compute f(f(....(f(x))....)) (apply f a total n times). For example, repeated(square, 3)(42) evaluates to square(square(square(42))). Yes, it makes sense to apply the function zero times! See if you can figure out a reasonable function to return for that case.


def repeated(f, n):
  """Return the function that computes the nth application of f.

  >>> add_three = repeated(increment, 3)
  >>> add_three(5)
  8
  >>> repeated(triple, 5)(1) # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 1
  243
  >>> repeated(square, 2)(5) # square(square(5))
  625
  >>> repeated(square, 4)(5) # square(square(square(square(5))))
  152587890625
  >>> repeated(square, 0)(5)
  5

Hint: You may find it convenient to use compose1 from the textbook:

def compose1(f, g):
    """Return a function h, such that h(x) = f(g(x))."""
    def h(x):
        return f(g(x))
    return h
